# Gene-network-community-detection
It is a research project aiming at cluster the human genes. Data we have is a network (a adjacency matrix) and the normalized RNA-Seq counts for each gene with each patients. I am wokring on merging these two types of data source to see if can proper clusters for human genes.

## Folders:
* Multivariate Normal:
   contains works based on assuming when conditoinal on the class labels, each row (gene) follows a Multivariate Normal with n dimension which is the number of patients.
